\section{Background and Motivation}

As of 2024, we stand in the face of turbulent geopolitics, frequent extreme weather events, and escalating living cost all around the world. And we chose to make a small step today towards a greater impact tomorrow. Unreasonable consumer demands is believed to be one of the leading factors that is keeping us behind on our goal of developing sustainable societies and planet. UN SDG goal 12 promotes sustainable consumption and production patterns, ensuring efficient use of natural resources.

This inspired us to found G2U. We are developing on online e-commerce platform where every treasure has a find its second life, to a new owner. Finding the gap in this nascent niche market, we intend to incorporate lean startup model to gain market knowledge \& feedback to the maximum. Then, our agile engineering team will capitalize on the market input swiftly to capture the sizable market share.
